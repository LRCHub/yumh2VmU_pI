I come here and I have the holy right
Now let me tell the story
You better shut your mouth
Or you'd be heading south
Now come with me and walk into the night

Goodbye the evil eye I gotta go away
You know I have never strayed
You'd better call the fire brigade
And can't you see that I will always win
And can't you see that I'll be back again

Now I wanna reach you
And I'm gonna teach you

I'm selling my soul
But I'm still evergreen

I see my reflection, it's finally me
Still evergreen
And my higher power, is my remedy
Still evergreen
I have been elected and now I am free
Still evergreen
Now I'm selling my soul but it's still evergreen

Don't let me down, now don't you hesitate
Did you receive my warning?
You kiss the sky eventually
Did you receive my recipe?
Now let me be the one who lives in peace
