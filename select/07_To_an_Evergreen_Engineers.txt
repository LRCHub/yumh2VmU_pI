I felt the seasons change by the way you turned your eyes
Away from where I stood to an evergreen
I'm sure the sun will rise by the way you raise your head
Like it's all a dream that you have to leave

I've found my own place to be
And now you stand clear away from me
You sound so far there is no dream
That's taking me back to where I was
And face to face we're falling down
You're safe with your own respect for it
Your voice so far it sounds unreal
There's no one to tell me not to go

I have seen people change it's not always for the best
Their leaves fall less and less like an evergreen
Across the mountain range as a bolt coms from the blue
Equations ringing through like a lazer beam

I've found my own place to be
And now you stand clear away from me
You sound so far there is no dream
That's taking me back to where I was
And face to face we're falling down
You're safe with your own respect for it
Your voice so far it sounds unreal
There's no one to tell me not to go
