You believe the world'll come to you
That it turns in spite of everything
Don't dry your tears for me
You're feeling alone
Just know

That you to me
Are as evergreen as pure melody
And you to me
Is the air I breathe
So lean on me
143

You wonder how it could be different
But it's easier to keep moving on
Don't hide your tears from me
About being alone
Well I know

That you to me
Are as evergreen as pure melody
And you to me
Is the air I breathe
So lean on me
143

Care for you
I'll be there
There for you
When you get lonely
Care for you
I'll be there for you
There for you
When you get lonely
