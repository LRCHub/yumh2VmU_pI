The words we say old flowers fade away
Remember yesterday wish it would bloom again
Apathy and pain here comes the Autumn rain
Old apologies scattered in the wings of fate

Cause today it all looks black and white wish it would change
We cant keep painting colours when its

Don't hesitate cause you will bleed
A thousand tears wont wash it clean
Don't hesitate cause you can free yourself
Evergreen evergreen

Down on my knees crawling though the streets again
Surrendered to my needs so I can breathe the air
You're my evergreen Regents Park in spring
It takes me to a place where I can dream again

Cause today it all looks black and white wish it would change
We cant keep painting colours when its

Don't hesitate cause you will bleed
A thousand tears wont wash it clean
Don't hesitate cause you can free yourself
Evergreen evergreen

I just want some place where I can breathe without this bitter taste

Cause today it all looks black and white wish it would change
We can't keep painting colours when its grey
It all looks black and white today

Don't hesitate cause you will bleed
A thousand tears wont wash it clean
Don't hesitate cause you can free yourself
Evergreen evergreen

Don't hesitate cause you will bleed
A thousand tears wont wash it clean
Don't hesitate cause you can free yourself
Evergreen evergreen
Evergreen evergreen evergreen
